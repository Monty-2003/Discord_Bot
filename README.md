DS2002: DS Systems Final Project pt2


Deliverable: Create and publish an interactive Discord bot in a test server.

A Discord bot must be backed by a Python-backed application that runs actively with an open connection to the Discord activity API and is invoked by bot commands and messages. You must write and publish this app, and it should connect to your data source from Project 1. YOU CAN build a new one if you didn’t like / want your first.

 

Your bot does not have to be "serious" – for instance it could play a game or quiz, but the seriousness will be found in how your application handles data, performs remote retrieval and processing of requests and replies.

 

If you choose this option, create your own server and be sure to invite me and matt to it.

 

There are many good resources to show you how to set up a Discord bot:

 

Benchmarks:

 

Your bot should recognize a "help" message and reply with user instructions.
Your bot should provide at least three commands or functions (See our tutorial on Discord)
Your bot should reply promptly with an intelligent response or an informative error message.
Your bot should integrate with at least one external data source that you can document and describe. This could be a database system or API from your first project. You can use your chatbot code from GPT or the homework, or custom. It’s up to you.
Submit all code in a standalone GitHub repository in your account.
 

Grading:

 

Successful build of the bot and be able to run it on the server. Shot proof of life from screen shots or running in the test server I gave you.– 10 points
Functionality that meets all benchmarks – 10 points
Creativity / Innovation / Quality – 2 points
Documentation – Describes how to use the bot and the elements that make it operational – 3 points
